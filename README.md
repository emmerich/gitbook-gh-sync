# Welcome

{% hint style="info" %}
:rocket: We're celebrating docs this week and launching several new features! Follow along with our daily announcement posts!
{% endhint %}

We want to help **teams to work more efficiently** with a simple but powerful platform that helps them **share their knowledge**.

Our mission is to make a **user-friendly** and **collaborative** product for everyone to create, edit and share knowledge through documentation.
